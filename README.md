# Spam Classifier using Machine Learning

This project is a machine learning-based spam classifier that predicts whether a message is **Spam** or **Not Spam (Ham)** using a pre-trained model.

##  Project Overview
Spam messages are a common issue in communication systems.  
This project uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and a trained machine learning model to classify messages.

##  Technologies Used
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)

##  Project Files
- `app.py` – Main application file
- `model.pkl` – Trained machine learning model
- `vectorizer.pkl` – Text vectorizer used for transforming input text

##  How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install scikit-learn
